## Description

This directory contains the supplementary material for Method 1: Competing endogenous RNAs in CRC
and Method 2: A biological and clinical feature analysis to predict recurrence and patient survival in CRC.

Each folder contains data regarding one of the developed methods


## Structure

### Method 1

Files related to Method 1: Competing endogenous RNAs in CRC.

```
metadata = related TCGA metada files to be downloaded
manifest = related TCGA expression files to be downloaded
```

The folders inside method1/supplementary_material are divided per anatomical site where:
```
cerna = cerna related results
de = de analysis related results
enrichment = functional analysis results
survival = survival analysis results
```

### Method 2

Files related to Method 2: A biological and clinical feature analysis to predict recurrence and patient survival in CRC

```
input = files for each group used to train the model
models = pickled trained models 
```
